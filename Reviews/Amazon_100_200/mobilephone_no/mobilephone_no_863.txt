This is super cute, but not as user friendly as the Apple and Nokia phones I also use (Apple for my US account and the others as unlocked phones that can take an international SIM when travelling).  Making calls or texting are super easy, but web browsing or apps are very difficult to use due to the tiny screen size.  I still havent been able to figure out how to use most of the features.  It is not terribly user-friendly.This phone appears to be made for a Mexican or South American market.  The instruction booklet was only in Spanish and in one screen when it asked me where I was located the only choices were Mexico and three SA countries.Mine came with dark pink, black, and orange back plates.  It is one of the cutest phones I have had and is perfect for my use, but I wouldn't want to use it as a smart phone.

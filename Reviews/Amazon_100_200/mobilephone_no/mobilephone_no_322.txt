I am very disappointed with the iPhone 3 I purchased.  I tried downloading applications such as skype, facebook, what's app, etc. only to find out that the latest software the phone is compatible with is iOS 4.2.1.  All the apps require at least iOS 4.3 or later which makes this phone a complete waste of money.  I live outside of the U.S. and the only reason I bought this phone was to be able to have access to iphone applications through wifi.  I used an android phone before and had no idea of this software update issue with old iphones.  If anyone knows of any solutions to this problem I would like to know.

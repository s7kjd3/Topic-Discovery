This was an excellent unlocked Android phone on ATT 3G. (This, coming from someone who foolishly purchased it directly from Google for more than $500 when it first came out). I loved loved loved this phone. Unfortunately, at twenty months it began to randomly go into a reboot loop, and become very warm at the bottom under the battery door. HTC support recommended exporting my contacts and then a factory reboot. Did that, without re-installing any of my apps, and the random reboot loops and overheating continued. The phone was undependable/unusable and out of warranty. The expense of sending it back to HTC and being without a phone for an undetermined time period was enough to make me decide to pull the SIM card and purchase another new unlocked phone (the Samsung Nexus S, which is even better than the Google Nexus One).

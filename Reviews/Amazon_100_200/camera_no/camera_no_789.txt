Had this camera for the past 7 months. Taken app. 850 photos till date. No issues what so ever and excellent photo quality. But you need to buy an additional battery -- which would have been the case with any camera with chargeable batteries. You can turn off Continuous Autofocus and reduce battery drain. I do use high speed compact flash memory cards such as SanDisk Ultra II 256 MB ( currently the best ) and Lexar Media 256 MB USB 12X with my camera otherwise the wait time between consecutive shots can be very high.Pros :: 5MP, 8X zoom, lightweightCons :: in-built flash is not sufficient, especially outdoors photography. Using NIKON SB-50DX Autofocus Speedlight with my camera.

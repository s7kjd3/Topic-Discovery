After a few months, the internal flash on my 5700 stopped working.  I've been researching this issue on the web and I am definitely not the only one who has this problem.  Getting this problem fixed by Nikon will cost you $250 - $300.  I was not a big user of the flash in the first place but it is a huge disappointment to have a problem with such a basic feature on a "prosumer" camera.  I have also had miserable results with the auto-focus in low light conditions.  This is another common complaint about this camera.  Now I wish that I had bought a Canon.

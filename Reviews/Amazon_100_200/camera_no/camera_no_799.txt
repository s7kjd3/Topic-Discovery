I bought this camera after reading a very positive review in a major "consumer" based magazine.  8 months later the image chip went defective.  Just as the same "consumer" magazine reported in a later issue.  Nikon fixed this for "free", they would not pay for the incoming shipping ($30).Now 4 months later the flash does not work, the ISO settings do not change, the auto-focus is a no-go.What a piece of junk!  Nikon won't pay for these problems either!DO NOT buy!  Get the D50 or Rebel XT instead.UPDATE!  Nikon has issued a service bulletin for this model.  This is the second SERIOUS issue and this piece of junk went back for the second time in its 16 month life.I repeat-do NOT buy!  Get the Canon Digital Rebel XT instead!!!

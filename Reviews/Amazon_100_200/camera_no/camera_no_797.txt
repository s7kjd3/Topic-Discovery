It's obviously a great camera and there are many pros. I'm sure it's not a problem to find what's great. I've spent some time comparing this camera with others so I want to share what cons I've found.1. Motorized zoom. Many people feel much better about manual zoom ring.2. Price. It's a few hundred dollars higher then close competitors.3. Proprietary batteries. Usually proprietary means less freedom and higher price.4. Zoom range. It's very impressive 35-280mm but if you take wide angle shots (e.g. inside small rooms or shoot buildings on narrow streets) then you might prefer to have zoom starting at 28mm...Everything else is just either perfect or very good.

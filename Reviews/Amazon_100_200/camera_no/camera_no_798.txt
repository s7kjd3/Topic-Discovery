Have had the camera for about a week and find that on auto that it is easy to use but once you go into the menus, there is a steep learning curve that will take forever to learn and it is very frustrating.  The image quality to my eye is amazing again on auto but on manuel sometimes it works and other times it refuses to work.  The flash is so bright that it washes out things and so I have to go to the low light flash and it is again not readily available but have to push buttons to get there.  I am not sure had I really known all of this I would have bought this camera but maybe gone for dslr instead.  Check it out carefully before you make this decision.

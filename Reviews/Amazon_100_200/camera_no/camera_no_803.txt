This is my 3rd digital camera and the first that has a large enough resolution per photo to enlarge well past 4x6.  The zoom action is wonderful.  And yes, I like the small lightweight size ~ such a difference from my SLR.I have found the menus and manual modes very easy to learn.  I've just had the camera a couple weeks but I'm thrilled with it.I do have a **QUESTION** for other Nikon Coolpix 5700 owners:I bought a 256m Sandisk Compact Flashcard along with the camera, as recommended by one of your reviewers.  However, the Nikon manual states a flashcard range from 16-128m.  Before I open the packaging of the 256m I'd appreciate assurance that I am not limited to a 156m card, as I was with a previous digital camera.

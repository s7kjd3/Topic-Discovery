I've only had the camera two days, but I'm already enjoying it.  I was a little nonplussed to have buttons on the side that are on the back of my 995, but the focus is better, and it takes closeups (at the farthest focal length without going past what's between the W----T.  I learned with the 995, and this one is the same, that if you go to 1X, 2X or 4X, etc., you'd better have the camera on a tripod.  My 995 doesn't go on a tripod, and it doesn't even have a place to plug in a remote control switch, so I'm glad that this one does.  :)  I'm going to enjoy this camera very much.

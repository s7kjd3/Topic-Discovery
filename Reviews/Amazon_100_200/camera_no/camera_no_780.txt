Used the camera for abt 2 years, without any problem, was very happy..and suddenly there was no picture/image shown in the lcd or the view finder.. like the lense cap is on or something,, while the camera is on.. it just shows the menu settings. but does not show any image.someone told me , i might have tried to take the battery out while keeping the camera in "ON" position.. this might damage the circuit..I cant believe it, i mean so many people can do that either un-knowingly or just by mistake or in a hurry/rush ..if this is a real cause of the problem i am having , then this is utterly riduculous.. and i cant expect this from a company like nikon.. i waited for almost 2 years to buy a good camera, and when i finally had money i bought this one ..

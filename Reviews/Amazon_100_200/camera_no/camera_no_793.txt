As a novice shutterbug, a simple point & shoot digital was fine at first, but as I gained confidence, and became a little more serious, I found that I had quickly outgrown my Cannon A40.  The Nikon 5700 seemed to be exactly what I needed, so I purchased one.  To say I love the camera, would be an understatement!  I'm still learning how to do what I want to, but being completely self-taught as far as photography, I understand there will be a learning curve.  The features are supurb, without being overwhelming.  While I'm sure the professional would consider it "not enough"... it more than suits my needs as my "hobby" grows.  Perhaps one day, I'll want/need/be ready for a high end camera, but for under 1K, this one will definately help me develop my skills for quite some time!

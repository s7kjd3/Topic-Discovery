All I've got to say is that this camera is great! I have owned this camera for 9 months now and have not been disappointed. Colors are accurate and images are precise. If you're looking for a point and shoot camera, this camera works, but once you discover the results, you realize this is a serious camera. The 8X optical zoom lets you get in close for professional results, without intruding. It's a camera you can get into to explore your imagination and photography to it's fullest.Pros: 5MP, 8Xoptical zoom, point and shot, aperture priority, shutter priority. Plus you can add on lens, filters, and external flash.Cons: Buy an extra battery or 2, batteries last 90 minutes of continuous use. Using file formats of RAW, or TIF, you'll either need a bigger hard drive or CD burner to save images.As with most digital cameras, image size & quality dictates the camera's response time.

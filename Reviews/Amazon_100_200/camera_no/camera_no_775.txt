I use it almost every day.  I make images of the building that I'm building, beautiful macros, my dog, everything.  Reading the manual is key, and even better (the best) is going to the Nikon School when it's in your area.  I learned so much from that!  With the automatic settings, it takes great shots, and when you learn to customize your settings, you can get fantastic images.  I have an N6006, and an F3, and I think I'm going to sell them, I only use this camera.  The only drawback in my mind is that it isn't true TTL, and the "larger" lcd display is dinky considering the price of the camera.  But the compromise is OK.  I've done everything from macro work to scenics.  And with a good tripod, I've even merged shots into panoramics.  I lovelovelove this little camera!

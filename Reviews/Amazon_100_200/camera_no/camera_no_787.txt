I have had my Coolpix 5700 for several years and rarely go anywhere without it. It takes great pictures unless there is low light. It is impossible to get decent shots in the late evening or in the house. The controls are pretty complicated, but I leave almost everything on auto and this works most of the time. It is a very tough camera and has taken a LOT of abuse from me (including being dropped on bricks from a few feet up). I love my camera but it is not for the casual user.Buy 2 batteries! Always keep one on the charger and you will be thankful.

The 5 Megapixel Nikon 5700 has been around a while, and people continue to love it and hate it. The optics are why you buy Nikon, and this is one sharp lens.  It's complicated to operate if you want to do manual settings (M, A, S), but the Program mode will suffice for most people.  It will shoot in RAW mode, unusual for a consumer camera.  That gives you a lot of flexibility in adjusting the image.  If you're not willing to read the manual though, this may not be the camera for you.  Sort of like driving a manual transmission, it's so easy once you know how but you have to give it the effort to practice.Nikon supports this camera with repair if you have problems, flat rate is reasonable (go to Nikon USA direct, dealers mark up).  One common problem is the CCD failing, due to a Sony image sensor that a lot of camera makers used.  Free repairs in about 2 weeks, but it's annoying.  After that fix, this is a solid camera.  I like mine, and shoot a lot of quick shots with it.

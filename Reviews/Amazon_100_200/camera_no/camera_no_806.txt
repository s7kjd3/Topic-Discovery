I have used Nikon SLR for about 15 years now and I have always admired the quality I get from them. A friend of mine let me play with his new 5700 to see what I think about it.I first asked him the price he paid and although it is abit on the high side, i dismissed it initially and went on to the test if really this camera does deliver relative to its price. Controls are well placed, a nikon quality i like and the materials used are top-notched. However image quality is not what I expected. I have seen and tried digicams from Olympus and Minolta and they have better color reproduction and image saturation. Even the Fuji S7000 seems to have better "printed image than the Nikon and to think that the Fuji only sells for U$600.00. If the Nikon were priced at least at the level of the others, I would be hard pressed not to reconsider it but it is no very competitive price and feature wise.

I purchased the Nikon 5700 for travel in India. I have used the camera in a two month period to make over 500 pictures from the rain forest of Southern India to 7 degree temperatures in the United States. The zoom ability, pixel strength, and ease of use have proven themselves. I came to the camera from extensive use of Nikon SLRs 35mm. I have enjoyed the transition and capabilities of this camera. I thought it would be a backup, simple use camera but have found it to work in all situations, panarama, portrait and macro. 4 of us went on the trip to India all armed with digital cameras. The quality of my photos, especially the enlargements stole the show. Another Nikon quality product!!

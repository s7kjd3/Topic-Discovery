This camera is great, some people complain about being too complicated, but I want to tell you what this camera is.This camera is the top of the line for Nikon prosumer cameras, so shows advanced features other cameras of its kind does not have.  It is the last step before buying a professional digital camera, being professional an 'interchangeable lens SLR digital camera'.To fully understand this camera you should have owned 2 cameras before.  1) A 35mm SLR  2) An entry level digital cameraif you have that background you'll find the 5700 just great, but if you don't, then you'll be stuck wondering what is an f stop or why you cannot (actually should not) send raw images by e-mail to your friends.Because its lenses cannot be interchanged they must be treated carefully.  One of my next adquisitions will be the Nikon 5597 67MM FILTER ADAPTER RING, a 67mm UV filter and a 67mm lens cap.I would also recommend getting the 'Nikon Camera Case for Nikon Coolpix 5700 Digital Camera'

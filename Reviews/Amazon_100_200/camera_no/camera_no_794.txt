The Nikon digital cameras I've tested over the last year have not fared so well against comparibly priced models by Sony and Olympus, but the 5700 is a huge step in the right direction.  The optics are a significant improvement over other Coolpix models tested and in particular, the problems at wide angle have been reduced.  The 8x optical zoom and fast continuous shooting mode make this one of the better consumer 5 MB action cameras on thre market today.  And, as usual, flash performance is a step ahead of the competition.  At 1,200 bucks, this super performance doesn't come cheap, but if your needs match the 5700's fortes, you'll love it.  Solid class A.

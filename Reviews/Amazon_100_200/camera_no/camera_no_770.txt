This camera is awesome.  While contemplating either going up to a digital SLR or not, I discovered the 5700.  After holding the unit in my hands, I fell in love with it.  The functions are amazing, not missing many functions of SLR digitals.  However, because of the point-and-click ability, the camera functions and its small size, it functions as my everyday camera as well as my portrait camera during my professional jobs.  Although it lacks the "professional" look of a big, bulky SLR camera, my results are arguably equivalent to those made with my film-based SLR.  I would highly, highly recommend this camera.  My only complaint is the lengthy time that it takes to write to the disk.  I understand that it is not extremely lengthy for digitals, but I see that as the main drawback in my experience of digitals against analog, film-based photography.  However, my write speed has significantly been increased by use of Viking cards rather than SanDisk (very slow media) cards.

Having been an early adopter for digital cameras, I've played with and owned many over the years.  My recent purchase of the Nikon 5700 has reignited my love for photography!  The camera gives you a ton of control (although I am still learning) and the lens is FABULOUS!  I love being able to zoom way in on the subject, frame and focus, and blur out the background the way that this great lens can.  The resolution on the resulting image is excellent, and I am very pleased with every image I've had printed at a service provider ...I highly recommend this camera for anyone who loves a little more control with their camera!

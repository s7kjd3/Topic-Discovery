I used this camera for 3months (about 500 shots) and was shocked to see a damaged pixel in the CCD. A red color dot appeared in the shots and the camera became useless. I have sent it to Nikon (through RitzCamera) for repair and it is more then 5 weeks now. No updates on the repair work could be obtained from Nikon/Ritzcamera - very poor customer service given the fact that I have already spent more then $ on this product.I really feel sorry to have spent so much on 5700.Latest: May 14, 2003: I got my CP5700 replaced with a brand new piece. It took me 5 months and 3 shipments (to NikonInc NY), to make this happen.

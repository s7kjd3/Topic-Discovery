I've had the CoolPix 8800 for about 2 months. It is a remarkable alternative to more expensive digital SLR cameras. My first priority was to buy a camera that had RAW (Nikon NEF) file format capabilities. The 8800's 8-megapixel RAW images are 12 MB files. Even with a 50X CompactFlash memory card, individual files can take as long as 10 seconds to write/save. And while the file is saving, you can't adjust settings such as shutter speed or exposure. It can be a very frustrating wait. I'll keep trying various high-speed cards, hoping I can get better results, and update this review if I find "the perfect card." (NOTE: Write times are much faster using the multiple JPG or TIFF formats. But if you're not going to use RAW, there are less expensive alternative cameras to consider.)I would still buy this camera over anything else available when I purchased it. The 10X zoom with VR image stabilization is unbeatable!

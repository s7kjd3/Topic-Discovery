After playing around with it, I have to agree with previous reviews. The only thing I would add is the fact that store managers pointed out to me that the only way to do webcam is using Facetime. This is not true at all. I downloaded the yahoo messenger app and was able to do webcam with yahoo users on Windows PCs. For Ebook readers it is an awesome device. It has all the features of a Nook and if you turn the Ipad sideways (landscape) it will show both side of the pages as if you were reading a real book. I also like the graphics on the way the pages flip.

I've had my iPad2 for 8 months now and absolutely love it. It is so much better to take to class because it hardly weighs anything. I downloaded apps for note-taking in class and I can write notes directly on my powerpoint slides (which is what most professors use in lecture). I also put some educational apps for my 2 year-old son and he loves them too.  The speed is great (no lag time opening and closing apps, safari, photos, and anything else). As of right now, I don't have any negative comments to write about it, but if I later do, I'll post a response about it.

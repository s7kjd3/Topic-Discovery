I got my Apple iPad for Christmas this year and i havent been able to leave its side since. There are truly no limits when using it. I can create and edit any word documents I need for school, watch HD movies, listen to all my music, Skype/ FaceTime, quickly and easily download new songs/ apps/ videos, read books and magazines(mostly at no cost), take great looking pictures, play games... etc. The list goes on and on... and on. The only thing I have had any trouble with at all was installing the new update. I would recommend installing it before putting any media or info on it. It just makes the process alot longer and more frustrating. Reguardless, I think Apple has outdone themselves with this device. It is more than just an oversized/ overpriced iPod. I love my iPad.ps. I recomend getting a Smart Cover.Apple iPad 2 Polyurethane Smart Cover - Gray (MC939LL/A) It protects my beloved iPad very well and is worth more than what I paid for it.Warning: Beware of imitators! They dont work at all and are everywhere!

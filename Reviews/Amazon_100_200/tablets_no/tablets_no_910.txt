For a Windows only user, this is a pretty good transition to touchscreen based computing.  Best feature for Windows users - SUPERFAST BOOT TIME EVEN WHEN POWERED OFF.  There are a few hiccups though.  Cut, Copy, and Paste can be tricky.  Transitioning between applications are fairly easy by pressing the home button twice.  Another issue is usb.  It's pretty much non-existent.  Some forums state you might get lucky with your usb device using the camera connection hookup from Apple, but the only file types that can be read are pics.  The biggest complaint is the same as many windows users going to an Apple product - NO FLASH.  Overall it's pretty good, but I recommend the 32 gb over the 16 gb if you have the money like most Apple veterans tend to have.

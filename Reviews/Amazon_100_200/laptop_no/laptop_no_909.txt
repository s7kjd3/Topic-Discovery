Out of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best! I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier. I'm not sure if it was covered in the description, but it does have a backlit keyboard and I'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge (Except I don't use this for games or videos, which obviously would drain the battery faster). It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid. The screen has an extremely high resolution that I'm very pleased with. Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money. I have only used PCs in the past, and it's easy to see that Apple is just more advanced. You will not regret buying this computer!

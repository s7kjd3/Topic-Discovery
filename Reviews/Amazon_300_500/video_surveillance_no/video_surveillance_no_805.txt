I'll first say that I am VERY happy with this video monitor.  I just returned the Lorex LIVE Snap which is honestly pathetic.  The build quality was TERRIBLE.  Some of the main selling features didn't even work...and the list goes on.Now on to the Motorola Monitor.  After returning the Lorex, I just wanted to find something that worked no matter what the price.  I'll list several features that I really like about this product below.(For a frame of reference, I'm a gadget geek and a tool guy.  I'm the guy that gets every new iPhone as it comes out--Form and Function are key and I research everything)1. The Motorola has a solid build with some weight to it.2. I really like the kickstand feature on the monitor.3. The motion on the camera is completely silent and the range of movement is fantastic.4. Range is incredible. Our bedroom is on the opposite side of the house from the nursery and we still have full signal.5. The resolution is pretty good--compared to iPhone 4, not so great.  But for the purpose it serves, its fine.6. Two-way communication is very easy and convenient--not too tinny on the camera side (wouldn't scare the baby)7. Our thermometer seems to be accurate, I know others have said it was off.Some improvements could be:1. A way to mute all sound from the speaker.  You can only turn it down low.  We're learning to deal with it.2. A VOX feature where the unit sleeps to preserve battery until movement or sound are detected.3. A clock would be nice.4. The feature where you can hook it to your TV is great.  However, Motorola doesn't provide you with the cable.Otherwise, this really is the best camera I found through my research.  You might also note that this is the most popular unit on Amazon.  I would highly recommend this product.

First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.

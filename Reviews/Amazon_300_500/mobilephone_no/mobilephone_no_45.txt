I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.

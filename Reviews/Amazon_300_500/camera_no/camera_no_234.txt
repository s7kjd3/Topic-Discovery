I bought the Coolpix 5700 after I sold my older Sony DSC-P1 3.3MP camera. I missed the manual flexibility I had with my older SLR cameras and the 5700 gave me the best of both worlds, a point-and-shoot camera with Nikon's superb metering and autofocus, and full manual control over all of its functions. Pictures come out GREAT in 5MP (averaging 1.7MB each on 2560x1920 1:4 JPEG compression), handling is GREAT after you learn where everything is.The included 16MB flash card is not very useful. You can store an average of 6 snapshots at 2560x1920 Fine (1:4) mode. So, Amazon was offering the Viking 512MB Compact Flash Card for less than $$ and I took it:It gives me an average of 209 shots at 2560x1920 Fine (1:4) mode. So, I can be away from a computer for a while before the need to offload the pictures and format the card.I'm sure other reviews on the net tells stories about how GREAT this camera is, but let me tell you about my disappointments:- I feel I should make a comment on the battery, Nikon did a good job by making one battery for the entire Coolpix line, this makes it easier for you to buy extra batteries when needed. However, an extra battery is a MUST. That's why Nikon included the external battery charger with the camera, you can charge a battery while you use one (my old Sony had a power supply that plugged into the camera, which tied up the camera during charging times.)- I usually install a UV filter on my SLR cameras to protect the lens, I failed to find a UV filter for the 5700 and no adapters are available yet for it. I noticed that the Coolpix 4500 has a standard 28mm thread, which could have been made for the 5700.

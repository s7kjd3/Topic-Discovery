There is nothing like a Nikon lens.  The clarity, the guarantee that every shot will be perfect.I traded up from the Coolpix 995 (somehow it was a bit too small and the winding motion just didn't suit me).  This is more like an SLR in size.  The 5700 is packed with goodies and if you have had any experience at all with the Coolpix series, then this baby will be a cinch to use.  As it was, I was able to use it right out of the box.Improvements?  On Auto, the camera decides when you need a flash and it will automatically pop it up for you.  View finder or screen?  With a fold shut LCD screen, you can view your pictures there or use the familiar viewfinder.  And Zoom?  This camera practically reinvents the zoom.  It's quite simple to use.  Then, as you get the hang of basic pictures, you can get far more advanced with it.So.  Why only four stars?  First off, it is compact but a tad bit too small.  Gripping it is a bit of an oddity.  Even the manual highly recommends that you always use the neck strap.  But the biggest gripe I have is, how can they charge so much for this camera and ship it with an 8 MB card?  People are going to use this to get the best picture results so they're going to pump it up to the highest resolution available.  How many pictures do you think will fit on a card that small?  Amazon.com tried to relieve the situation by sending along a slightly larger card but if you are serious about this camera, you have to buy at least a 128 (for vacations, etc., you'd be best with a 256).So, the Nikon quality is still there.  A little bit smaller in size, a bit clumsy to handle and you have to do some added shopping but this is a camera that is worth it.

If you are attracted to the Coolpix 5700 by the attractive price, you should keep in mind that this SLR-type digital camera first came out 2.5 years ago, which in digital photography chronology was more like the days when the dinosaurs roamed the earth.The 5700 is by no means an incapable camera. It has 5 megapixels, 8x optical zoom (which gives a range of 35-280 in 35mm equivalent), a swivel LCD screen, and electronic viewfinder (EVF).  EVF shows you what the lens sees, so this is an SLR-type camera, except the lens cannot be changed.  The built-in Nikkor lens is actually very high-quality and is designated ED by Nikon: the ED stands for extra-low dispersion, refering to the high-quality glass used to make the lens.The lens, in fact, is the best part of the 5700 at the after-rebate price: if you want to get a professional-quality zoom lens for a low, low price, the 5700 gives you a lot of bang for the buck, so you are basically getting a capable 5MP digital camera for free.  On the other hand, the 5700 is showing its age in other departments: auto-focus capability (esp. problematic in low light situations), processing speed, shutter lag, etc.  More recent models such as the Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 have better functions and are better supported by Nikon, and also have better picture quality plus more pixels.  (Remember: pixel count does not equal picture quality, just like hard drive capacity has nothing to do how fast a computer is.)In summary, while the 5700 was top-of-the-class two years ago when I first played with it -- and its professional zoom lens is fantastic -- it's showing its age as a digital camera and is effectively a discontinued model.  If you want an SLR-type digital camera, consider the newer Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 or the latest G-series from Canon or other similar cameras from Fujifilm or Konica Minolta.On the other hand, for semi-serious photography without spending too much money, the after-rebate 5700 makes a terrific value.
